## Font Classification
The font classification dataset is created from Almotanabi Poems and organized as a set of 20,000 images, 4000 for each labeled with one of five Arabic script types
- Thuluth
- Ruq‚Äôah
- Naskh
- Kufic
- Diwani
We evaluated the font classification model by testing it using the validation set of 20%. The results of validation loss: 0.1195% and the validation accuracy: 86%.

## Arabic OCR
The OCR dataset is created from Almotanabi Poems and organized as a set of 840 images, 168 for each labeled with one of five Arabic script types
- Thuluth
- Ruq‚Äôah
- Naskh
- Kufic
- Diwani
We evaluated the OCR model by testing it using a set of 250 images. The results of the CER Character Error rate:



| Font Type | Character Error rate |
| --- | --- |
| Thuluth | 83.50% |
| Ruq‚Äôah  | 43.50% |
| Naskh   | 24.70% |
| Kufic   | 19.30% |
| Diwani  | 50.50% |
